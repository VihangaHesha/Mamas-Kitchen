          <li>2 bay leaves</li>
          <li>
            1.2 litres/2 pints hot vegetable stock (made with boiling water and

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>
              First, prepare your vegetables. You need 1-1.25kg/2lb 4oz-2lb 12oz
              ripe tomatoes. If the tomatoes are on their vines, pull them off.
              <br />
              The green stalky bits should come off at the same time, but if
              they don't, just pull or twist them off afterwards. Throw the
              vines and green <br />
              bits away and wash the tomatoes. Now cut each tomato into quarters
              and slice off any hard cores (they don't soften during cooking and
              <br />
              you'd get hard bits in the soup at the end). Peel 1 medium onion
              and 1 small carrot and chop them into small pieces. Chop 1 celery
              stick roughly the same size.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>
              Spoon 2 tbsp olive oil into a large heavy-based pan and heat it
              over a low heat. Hold your hand over the pan until you can feel
              <br />
              the heat rising from the oil, then tip in the onion, carrot and
              celery and mix them together with a wooden spoon. Still with the
              heat low, <br />
              cook the vegetables until they're soft and faintly coloured. This
              should take about 10 minutes and you should stir them two or three
              <br />
              times so they cook evenly and don’t stick to the bottom of the
              pan.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <p>
              Holding the tube over the pan, squirt in about 2 tsp of tomato
              purée, then stir it around so it turns the vegetables red. Shoot
              the tomatoes <br />in off the chopping board, sprinkle in a good
              pinch of sugar and grind in a little black pepper. Tear 2 bay
              leaves into a few pieces <br />
              and throw them into the pan. Stir to mix everything together, put
              the lid on the pan and let the tomatoes stew over a low heat
              <br />for 10 minutes until they shrink down in the pan and their
              juices flow nicely. From time to time, give the pan a good shake –
              this will keep everything well mixed.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <p>
              Slowly pour in the 1.2 litres/2 pints of hot stock (made with
              boiling water and 4 rounded tsp bouillon powder or 2 stock cubes),
              <br />
              stirring at the same time to mix it with the vegetables. Turn up
              the heat as high as it will go and wait until everything is
              bubbling, <br />then turn the heat down to low again and put the
              lid back on the pan. Cook gently for 25 minutes, stirring a couple
              of times. <br />At the end of cooking the tomatoes will have
              broken down and be very slushy-looking.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Step 5</h4>
            <p>
              Remove the pan from the heat, take the lid off and stand back for
              a few seconds or so while the steam escapes, then fish out the
              pieces <br />of bay leaf and throw them away. Ladle the soup into
              your blender until it’s about three-quarters full, fit the lid on
              tightly and turn the machine <br />on full. Blitz until the soup’s
              smooth (stop the machine and lift the lid to check after about 30
              seconds), then pour the puréed soup into a large bowl. <br />
              Repeat with the soup that’s left in the pan. (The soup may now be
              frozen for up to three months. Defrost before reheating.)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Step 6</h4>
            <p>
              Pour the puréed soup back into the pan and reheat it over a medium
              heat for a few minutes, stirring occasionally until you can see
              <br />
              bubbles breaking gently on the surface. Taste a spoonful and add a
              pinch or two of salt if you think the soup needs it, plus more
              <br />
              pepper and sugar if you like. If the colour’s not a deep enough
              red for you, plop in another teaspoon of tomato purée and stir
              until it dissolves. <br />
              Ladle into bowls and serve. Or sieve and serve chilled with some
              cream swirled in.
